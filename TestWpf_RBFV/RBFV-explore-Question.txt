Is there any voxel raster approach in the machine learning? Since I'm relatively new in machine learning I can't be quite sure that this was not done before. So, if it was please share some links and skip further reading. 
When we use SVM or ANN we try to build hyperplane or hypersurface which separates data points in a best way, describing this hypersurface in the vector form. But data points itself can form a volumetric object (having a certain surface) if they would obtain dimensionality and some range of influence. For this purpose each data point should be represented by a radial basis function. By adding together all such RBFs, we obtain spatial image of the data that can be rasterized and stored. This approach can be useful for noise reduction and datasets with complicated clusters.
At the moment I have tried this approach on several 2D dummy data sources and on the one real data source. Here is some results:
